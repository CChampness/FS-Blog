## Features

* This is a CMS-style app that manages the content of a tech blog site.

* When users visit the site for the first time, they are presented with the homepage, which includes existing blog posts if any have been posted; navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard; and the option to log in.

* Whenever a user clicks on the homepage option, they are taken to the homepage.

* When a user clicks on any other links in the navigation zone, they are prompted to either sign up or sign in.

* When the user chooses to sign up, they are prompted to create a username and password.

* When a user clicks on the sign-up button, their user credentials are saved and they are logged into the site.

* When a user revisits the site at a later time and they choose to sign in, they are prompted to enter their username and password.

* When a user is signed in to the site, they see navigation links for the homepage, the dashboard, and the option to log out.

* When a user clicks on the homepage option in the navigation, they are taken to the homepage and presented with existing blog posts that include the post title and the date created.

* When a user clicks on an existing blog post, they are presented with the post title, contents, post creator’s username, and date created for that post and have the option to leave a comment.

* When a user enters a comment and clicks on the submit button while signed in, the comment is saved and the post is updated to display the comment, the comment creator’s username, and the date created.

* When a user clicks on the dashboard option in the navigation, they are taken to the dashboard and presented with any blog posts they have already created and the option to add a new blog post.

* When a user clicks on the button to add a new blog post, they are prompted to enter both a title and contents for their blog post.

* When a user clicks on the button to create a new blog post, the title and contents of the post are saved and the user gets taken back to an updated dashboard with the new blog post.

* When the user clicks on one of their own existing posts in the dashboard, they are able to delete or update their post.  Then they are taken back to an updated dashboard.

* When a user clicks on the logout option in the navigation, they get signed out of the site.

* When the user is idle on the site for more than a set time, then they will be able to view comments but they will be prompted to log in again before they can add, update, or delete comments.
